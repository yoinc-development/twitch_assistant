# Twitch Assistant

## Purpose
The idea of this tool is enable the streamer (ref. as the user) to use AI assistants to either read their chat and respond to their
audience or to talk to their AI assistant themselves and use it as a sort of sidekick.

The user can create multiple assistants based on their own needs and imagination. These prompts 
will be sent to ChatGPT and will be used to generate responses to the audience or to the user. 
The user themselves can see their conversations in the tool, however it is also possible for the 
tool to read the assistant's response out loud so that the broadcast can hear the conversation.

## Requirements
As of now, **three** requirements must be met for the tool to be functional:

- a Twitch account (TBA what the requirement will be)
- a fully set up [Google Cloud Platform account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- a [ChatGPT API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt)
